Blazingly fast™️ ⚡️, dependency free 🚫🗑️ matrix-esque number rain, similar to [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix). Automatically resizes with your terminal and gracefully shuts down at SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, resetting all color and cursor settings.

> Currently only works on macOS and will likely never work on Windows 🚮
